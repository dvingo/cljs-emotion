Use `mount!` options to toggle the initial state pull from root.\n   * `:optimized-render!` - A function that can analyze the state of the application and optimally refresh the screen.\n     Defaults to `multiple-roots-renderer` (highly recommended), but other options are available in the rendering package.\n     Further customizations are\n     also possible.  Most applications will likely be best with the default. Standard Fulcro components are also pure\n     (unless you supply `shouldComponentUpdate` to change that) to prevent rendering when props have not changed.\n   * `default-result-action!` - A `(fn [env])` that will be used in your mutations defined with `defmutation` as the\n     default `:result-action` when none is supplied. Normally defaults to a function that supports mutation joins, targeting,\n     and ok/error actions. WARNING: Overriding this is for advanced users and can break important functionality. The\n     default is value for this option is `com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations/default-result-action!`, which could be used\n     as an element of your own custom implementation.\n   * `:global-eql-transform` - A `(fn [AST] new-AST)` that will be asked to rewrite the AST of all transactions just\n     before they are placed on the network layer.\n   * `:client-will-mount` - A `(fn [app])` that is called after the application is fully initialized, but just before\n   it mounts. This is triggered when you call `app/mount!`, but after all internals have been properly initialized.\n   * `:client-did-mount` - A `(fn [app])` that is called when the application mounts the first time. WARNING: Due to\n     the async nature of js and React this function is not guaranteed to be called after the application is\n     completely on the DOM.  If you need that guarantee then consider using `:componentDidMount` on your application's\n     root component.\n   * `:remotes` - A map from remote name to a remote handler, which is defined as a map that contains at least\n     a `:transmit!` key whose value is a `(fn [remote send-node])`. See `networking.http-remote`.\n   * `:shared` - A (static) map of data that should be visible in all components through `comp/shared`.\n   * `:shared-fn` - A function on root props that can select/augment shared whenever a forced root render\n     or explicit call to `app/update-shared!` happens.\n   * `:props-middleware` - A function that can add data to the 4th (optional) argument of\n     `defsc`.  Useful for allowing users to quickly destructure extra data created by\n     component extensions. See the fulcro-garden-css project on github for an example usage.\n   * `:render-middleware` - A `(fn [this real-render])`. If supplied it will be called for every Fulcro component\n     render, and *must* call (and return the result of) `real-render`.  This can be used to wrap the real render\n     function in order to do things like measure performance, set dynamic vars, or augment the UI in arbitrary ways.\n     `this` is the component being rendered.\n   * `:remote-error?` - A `(fn [result] boolean)`. It can examine the network result and should only return\n     true when the result is an error. The `result` will contain both a `:body` and `:status-code` when using\n     the normal remotes.  The default version of this returns true if the status code isn't 200.\n   * `:global-error-action` - A `(fn [env] ...)` that is run on any remote error (as defined by `remote-error?`).\n   * `:load-mutation` - A symbol. Defines which mutation to use as an implementation of low-level load operations. See\n     Developer's Guide\n   * `:query-transform-default` - DEPRECATED. This will break things in unexpected ways. Prefer `:global-eql-transform`.\n   * `:load-marker-default` - A default value to use for load markers. Defaults to false.\n   * `:core-render!` - A `(fn [app options])` that is mean to side-effect and render your application. Normally does\n     binding of React-based dynamic vars and calls `optimized-render!`.\n   * `:render-root!` - The function to call in order to render the root of your application. Defaults\n     to `js/ReactDOM.render`.\n   * `:hydrate-root!` - The function to call in order to hydrate the root of your application. Defaults\n     to `js/ReactDOM.hydrate`.\n   * `:unmount-root!` - The function to call in order to unmount the root of your application. Defaults\n     to `js/ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode`.\n   * `:root-class` - The component class that will be the root. This can be specified just with `mount!`, but\n   giving it here allows you to do a number of tasks against the app before it is actually mounted. You can also use `app/set-root!`.\n   * `:submit-transaction!` - A function to implement how to submit transactions. This allows you to override how transactions\n     are processed in Fulcro.  Calls to `comp/transact!` will come through this algorithm.\n   * `:abort-transaction!` - The function that can abort submitted transactions. Must be provided if you override\n     `:submit-transaction!`, since the two are related.\"\n  ([] (fulcro-app {}))\n  ([{:keys [props-middleware\n            global-eql-transform\n            global-error-action\n            default-result-action!\n            core-render!\n            optimized-render!\n            render-root!\n            hydrate-root!\n            unmount-root!\n            submit-transaction!\n            abort-transaction!\n            render-middleware\n            initial-db\n            client-will-mount\n            client-did-mount\n            remote-error?\n            remotes\n            query-transform-default\n            load-marker-default\n            load-mutation\n            root-class\n            shared\n            external-config\n            shared-fn] :as options}]\n   (rapp/fulcro-app\n     (-> options\n       (assoc :core-render!
